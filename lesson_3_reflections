When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local

  With a remote repository, I can work on files either from my local computer, a remote computer or as someone to collaborate and contribute.

Why might you want to pull always manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository

  Pulling manually will help to manage pull periodically and purposefully. Else we might have two many file pull that needed or necessary

What is the difference between fork, clone, and branches

  fork is a copy of a repository that changes made will not be introduced to the original, clone is a copy of the original that changes made could be used pushed as a commit to the original, a branch is a new feature or change or commit to a project on a local pc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of your last known state of the remote stored locally.

  This is important because we can be able to monitor what changes was last made even if the changes were made by someone else in a group of collaborators.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you nedd to do it?

	Its creates a .git folder which holds the commits to the project I am working on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


The staging area provides a temporary hold for file that we want to commit, this is valuable in the sense we can easily note and be sure which files to commit before moving them to the git folder
